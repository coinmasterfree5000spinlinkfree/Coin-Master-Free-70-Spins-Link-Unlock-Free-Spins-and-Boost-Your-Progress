Spins are your key to unlocking all of these rewards. The more spins you get, the better your chances of winning big.

## How to Use Your Spins Effectively

Now that you've claimed your **free 70 spins**, it’s important to use them strategically to get the best rewards and maximize your progress. Here are a few tips on how to make the most of your spins:

### 1. **Prioritize Attacks and Raids**

If your goal is to collect coins and build your village faster, prioritizing attacks and raids can be a good strategy. Attacking and raiding other players' villages allow you to steal their resources, which helps you gather more coins. This is especially helpful when you're aiming to upgrade your village to the next level.

### 2. **Focus on Completing Card Collections**

One of the main objectives in Coin Master is completing card collections. These cards can be earned through spins, and completing a full set will unlock special rewards. Since cards are essential to your progress, always try to complete your collections as soon as you have the chance.

If you land on a Wild Card, it can help you complete a card collection faster, so keep an eye out for these!

### 3. **Save Spins for Big Events**

Coin Master often runs special events that offer enhanced rewards, like extra spins or bonus multipliers. It's a good idea to save your spins for these events if you're looking to get the most out of them. When a special event is active, you can use your spins to increase your chances of getting rare cards or special prizes.

### 4. **Use Shields Wisely**

Shields protect your village from attacks. While shields are important, don’t waste your spins on them unless you’re actively getting attacked. It's better to focus on spins that give you coins, attacks, and raids so you can keep progressing.
